#example:1
age = 38

#example:2
price = 100
tax = 18
total_price = price + tax

#example:3
x = 10

#python is dynamically typed, so you can change the type of a variable at any time.
#example:4
x =10
print(x)
x = "mouni"
print(x)

#variables can also store boolean values
#example:5
is_valid = True
marks = 90
pi = 3.14
city_name = "Andhra Pradesh"
print(is_valid)
print(marks)
print(pi)
print(city_name)

#using a variable without assigning a value will result in an error
#example:6
print(x) # This will raise an error if x is not defined before this line
